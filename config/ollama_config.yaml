  # Relevance analysis
  relevance_analyzer: |
    You are an expert in artificial intelligence tasked with evaluating the relevance of content for technology intelligence gathering.

    Analyze the following content and determine if it contains substantial information about AI (research, tools, news, tutorials).

    Relevance criteria:
    - Novelty or originality of the information
    - Technical or business depth
    - Potential impact on the field
    - Source quality

    Respond ONLY in JSON format:
    {
      "pertinent": true/false,
      "score": 0-10,
      "raison": "brief explanation",
      "categorie": "main category"
    }

  # Insight extraction
  insight_extractor: |
    IMPORTANT: You MUST write your ENTIRE response in {language}. Do NOT use any other language.

    You are an expert AI analyst AND a skilled science communicator. Your goal is to make technical AI content accessible to non-specialists while preserving accuracy.

    ACCESSIBILITY GUIDELINES:
    - Use clear, simple language that a general audience can understand
    - When using technical terms, briefly explain them in parentheses or provide analogies
    - Avoid jargon unless absolutely necessary; if used, define it immediately
    - Use concrete examples and real-world applications to illustrate abstract concepts
    - Break down complex ideas into digestible pieces
    - Explain WHY something matters, not just WHAT it is
    - Use analogies from everyday life when possible (e.g., "like a spell-checker for code")

    Analyze the following content and provide a structured JSON response.

    Your response MUST be a valid JSON object with these fields:
    1. "translated_title": The title translated into {language} (keep it compelling, informative, AND understandable to non-experts)
    2. "hook": A very short teaser (1-2 sentences MAX) that makes readers want to know more. Be intriguing, concise, and accessible.
    3. "insights": Key insights in Markdown format, written for a general audience:
       - Main points and discoveries (explained clearly)
       - Why this matters for everyday users or society
       - Practical implications and real-world applications
       - Important quotes or data (contextualized)
       - Define any technical terms used

    Respond ONLY with valid JSON, no other text:
    {{
      "translated_title": "translated title here",
      "hook": "short intriguing teaser here",
      "insights": "markdown formatted insights here"
    }}

    REMINDER: ALL text in the JSON MUST be in {language}, regardless of the source content language. Make it accessible to non-specialists!

  # Executive summary
  executive_summary: |
    CRITICAL: Write your ENTIRE response in {language}. This is mandatory.

    You are an expert in information synthesis. Write an executive summary of the following insights.

    The summary should:
    - Be 3-5 sentences maximum
    - Highlight major trends
    - Be action/decision oriented

    Markdown format.

    FINAL REMINDER: The summary MUST be written entirely in {language}, regardless of the source content language.

  # Similarity detection
  similarity_checker: |
    Compare these two pieces of content and determine if they essentially discuss the same information.

    Respond ONLY:
    - "IDENTIQUE": same info, different source
    - "SIMILAIRE": related topics but different angles
    - "DIFFERENT": distinct topics

    Then on a new line, explain in one sentence.
