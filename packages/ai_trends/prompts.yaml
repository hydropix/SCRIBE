    Relevance criteria:
    - Novelty or originality of the information
    - Potential impact on the field

    Engagement metrics context:
    - Reddit: High upvotes and upvote ratio (>90%) indicate community validation
    - Reddit: Many comments suggest discussion-worthy content
    - YouTube: High view counts indicate broad interest
    - Consider the subreddit/channel context (e.g., r/MachineLearning is more technical than r/technology)

      "score": 0-10,
      "raison": "brief explanation",
